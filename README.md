To run, add a path to "...\dota 2 beta\game\dota" folder as an argument. I.e:
  DotaMatchCheatSheet.jar "C:/Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/dota 2 beta/game/dota"
  
After launch, app will parse dotabuff pages of all the players in your last match (or the one you are currently loading in) and display all information in a compact table.
